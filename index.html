				<p>Giving the people who visit your website the ability to easily find the information that they are looking for is a key ingredient in creating a user friendly website. Website navigation that is easy to use and understand is essential to user-friendliness, but sometimes website visitors need more than intuitive navigation to find the content that they are seeking. This is where a website search feature can come in handy. You have a couple of options for putting up a search engine on your site, including using a CMS (if your site is built on a Content Management System) to power this feature. Since many CMS platforms use a database to store page content, <strong>these</strong> these platforms often come with a search utility to query that database. For example, my preferred CMS is ExpressionEngine, and this software has an easy-to-deploy utility to include site search on web pages built within that system. If your site does not run a CMS with this kind of capability, you can still add search to that site. You can run a CGI across your entire site, or JavaScript across individual pages, to add a search feature. You can also have an external site catalog your pages and run the search from that.</p>
